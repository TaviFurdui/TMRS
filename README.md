Here is a CodeBERT fine tuning code that uses DiverseVul dataset.
Software vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow, integer overflow, null pointer dereferencing, 
format string vulnerabilities, injections or memory leaks may be considered easy to avoid when 
programming by programmers with experience, but there are still a lot of these vulnerabilities 
found in projects around the world. These weaknesses pose a significant risk when exploited, 
potentially resulting in information leaks, damage to the reputation of a company, loss of customer 
trust and financial loss.
